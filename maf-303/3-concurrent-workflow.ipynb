Key demographics include young professionals, eco-conscious consumers, and rural commuters where public transport is limited. Essential features for a successful product include long battery life, affordability, lightweight design, and low maintenance. Opportunities lie in leveraging government subsidies, forming partnerships to promote eco-friendly transportation, and engaging communities through bike-sharing programs.
